    <h2>Detailed Orthopedic Surgeries</h2>
    <h3>Joint Replacement Surgery</h3>
    <p>We perform knee and hip joint replacements for patients suffering from severe arthritis or joint damage. This surgery replaces the damaged joint with an artificial one to reduce pain and improve mobility.</p>

    <h3>Fracture Fixation</h3>
    <p>For broken bones, we provide fracture fixation using plates, screws, or rods to properly align and heal the bones. This ensures faster recovery and better function after injury.</p>

    <h3>Arthroscopic Surgery</h3>
    <p>This is a minimally invasive surgery using small cameras and instruments inserted through tiny cuts. It is commonly used for joint repairs, such as meniscus tears or ligament reconstruction.</p>

    <h3>Spinal Surgery</h3>
    <p>We offer surgeries to relieve back pain and nerve problems caused by spinal issues like herniated discs or spinal stenosis. Our focus is on restoring spine health and reducing discomfort.</p>

    <h3>Sports Injury Treatment</h3>
    <p>Treatment and surgeries to repair sports injuries such as ligament tears, tendon damage, and joint instability, helping athletes return to their activities quickly and safely.</p>
